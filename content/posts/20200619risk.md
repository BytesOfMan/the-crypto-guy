Billionaire Larry Ellison knew there was a good chance he would drown in a few hours.

_Sayonara_ &mdash; his 78 foot racing yacht &mdash; was leading the 1998 Sydney to Hobart race. 

It was also falling apart.

Bulkheads critical to the structural integrity of the ship were no longer attached. Large blisters at the bow indicated the carbon fiber shell was separating from its foam core.

The hull wouldn't hold forever. 

The stomach churning impact at the bottom of each 40 foot wave could dash ship to pieces.

If they broke up, Ellison and his crew were too far out to sea for a helicopter rescue.

The racers enjoyed fine weather coming out of Sydney Harbor. The gradually intensifying winds didn't seem so bad. After 12 hours, _Sayonara_ was further ahead than the record holder had made it in 24 hours.

Then the winds jerked to 70 knots. Scanning his weather radar, Ellison saw what looked like Hurricane Helen from The Weather Channel.

"What the fuck is that doing here?" Ellison asked his professional navigator. He'd never seen anything like it before.

Fortunately for Ellison, his crew would make it to the finish line in Hobart. Only 44 of the 115 starting ships did. Racers abandoned 24 boats. The Australian coast guard rescued 55 sailors from the sea. Six died.

**Larry had alternatives**

Ellison's life was pretty good when he wasn't considering the stupidity of imminent death.

Usually he directed his 37,000 employees without going into the office. He preferred to keep in touch by phone from his 240 foot yacht _Katana_. He also owned a Japanese-style estate in Atherton, California. His custom built pond was specially filtered to ensure crystal clear water.

Ellison wrote short stories, played the piano, and piloted stunt planes.

Indeed the 1998 Sydney to Hobart race would be a life changing experience for Ellison. Asked if he would do another Hobart race, he famously answered "No, not if I live to be 1000." 

"I decided to focus on a more technical and less life-threatening form of sailing."

**Risk is a choice**

High risk is often confused with high return. 

Sure, sometimes the biggest potential return on an investment may come from a riskier investment. And there are no risk-free investments. 

**But that doesn't mean high risk implies high potential return.**

This is a pervasive error in crypto. People see the eye-popping returns of 2017 and look to recreate them by copying the symptoms of earlier success.

Bitcoin and Ethereum were risky investments. 

_I'll find something even riskier! It'll do even better!_

It's a seductive trap.

Indeed, the returns of 2017 were almost unbelievable. Anyone could have bought 2,000 ETH for 1 BTC in the September 2014 crowdsale. At the time, this was about $450.

Just 3 years later, two thousand ETH were worth $3 million.

Even today, well into a following bear market that has seen ETH fall more than 90% off its all time high, two thousand ETH are still worth $450,000. Not bad for a $450 initial position.

The popular notion is that larger cryptos have already had their day. You can only be a successful crypto investor if you find the _next_ ethereum, or the _next_ bitcoin!

I started seeing this attitude at crypto meetups in 2016. More and more attendees boasted of their positions in obvious criminal scams like OneCoin or Bitconnect.

Want to know a secret?

**Ethereum is the next ethereum. Bitcoin is the next bitcoin.**

And don't worry. If risk is your thing, there's still plenty attached to both. 

You don't need to take otherworldly risks to set yourself up for high returns. An investment in Ethereum today will be up 500% if another speculative bull run carries ETH back to its all time high. Bitcoin would be up 115%. 

**What are the odds we'll see another speculative bull run in crypto?**

I think the odds are good (and getting better in line with world money printing and world internet usage). But even if the odds are bad &mdash; they have to be very bad indeed to justify avoiding the space entirely.

You don't have to bet your life savings to position yourself for meaningful returns.
