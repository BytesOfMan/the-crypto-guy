I remember thinking how insane it was that Chipotle was a 10 billion dollar company.

This was in 2016, and that valuation (the price of all publicly traded Chipotle stock) was something like 40 times their annual earnings. Buying the stock back then would have implied one of three things.

**1\.** You had 100% confidence that Chipotle would move _at least_ exactly as many burritos as they did in 2016, right through the year 2056. This would allow you to break even on your investment.

**2\.** You had a good deal of confidence that Chipotle would move **exponentially more** burritos in the nearer future. Say 10 times the burritos in 5 years.

**3\.** You thought the stock would go up because perhaps other people would believe any of these reasons in the future.

**Fast forwardo to today.**

Coming off of several food poisoning scares, Chipotle has also recently gone through the same Covid19 as every other restaurant. Sure, they moved some burritos through UberEats.

The **lowest** their valuation ever reached was **\$13 billion.**

That is to say, even at the depths of a crisis where no one can eat at their restaurants, the stock market still figured they were 30% better off than 4 years ago (you know, back when they only had to keep moving those burritos for 4 decades to be worth the price).

**This morning, Chipotle is a \$27 billion company.**

That valuation is **80 times** their most recent annual earnings.

So. A bunch of food poisoning and the latest economic crisis have _more than doubled_ their valuation in less than 5 years. Amazing!

Of course, I can be something of a skeptic about the stock market. Maybe I'm the crazy one and the only way out of Covid19 is twice-daily government mandated guacamole enemas.

**Or maybe we are already experiencing high levels of inflation.**

On May 11, the Fed announced they will start buying ETFs, citing an "initial" amount of **\$750 billion.** In the last two months alone, the Fed has created _\$2.5 trillion_ dollars.

**The market cap of all cryptocurrencies in the world is only \$250 billion dollars.**

The Fed is printing that _every 6 days._

Look, anything is on the table for this crisis. Negative interest rates, considered impossible before 2008, are now all but guaranteed to roll out in the next year.

It's also possible that a $27 billion burrito company will be worth $270 billion before the $250 crypto market cap tops it's all time high of $800ish billion.

Personally, I wouldn't bet on it.

Crypto trading volumes are high and rising, right through the continued Covid19 crisis.

\$220 million of bitcoin [has been withdrawn](https://news.bitcoin.com/more-than-220m-in-bitcoin-withdrawn-from-crypto-exchanges-since-the-halving/) from exchanges since the halvening (just last week).

For all of that, prices in crypto remain astoundingly low. Bitcoin itself is perhaps a bit high, at nearly 50% it's all time high. But the mid-range cryptos like BCH and ETH remain at bargain basement prices (as does physical silver).

ETH is under \$200, or about 15% of its 2017 all time high. BCH, at \$240, is less than 10% of its 2017 all time high.

The last crypto bull run saw BTC pull away after a halvening before smaller cap cryptos blazed by. This trend is likely to hold true again, since it's not some mystical crypto chart magic prediction. We've seen the same thing happen with silver in a gold bull market.

If you don't have an account at any crypto exchange, click here to get started. Or just send me an email with your questions.

Or, if you think you know more about burritos than me (I warn you, my average Taco Bell order is well over \$20), order yourself some Chipotle stock.

To your financial sovereignty,

Joey
