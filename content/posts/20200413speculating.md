In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, what most people called "investment" was in fact gambling on what the federal authorities would support next.

In other words: speculating.

Speculating has a bad reputation.

It certainly lacks the sophisticated ring of "investing."

Never mind that many if not most of the storied fortunes of America were founded on speculation.

The frontier. The gold rush. The railroad. Oil.

And &mdash; finally &mdash; the stock market.

When the cash-strapped English aristocracy needed cash, they married into wealthy speculating American
families.

Winston Churchill's mother was the daughter of lengendary American speculator Leonard Jerome:

###### The Jerome Mansion. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Jerome" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jerome</a> was a flamboyant and successful stock speculator. He made and lost several fortunes, and was known as "The King of Wall Street"

**Speculating is still with us**

In the modern financial world, asset prices often have little to do with underlying valuations and much to do with hopes, dreams, and prayers.

We can complain about this (it's most of what I do) &mdash; but it would be better to accept it as a data point and modify our behavior accordingly.

**In crypto, hype abounds**

_Bitcoin will put the banks out of business! It will usher in a new era of human freedom! It will solve age old problems of finance and politics!_

Sure. And Uber will be profitable.

These things may all come to pass. I wouldn't have spent the last 7 years of my life in crypto if I didn't know there was a long term future beyond internet gambling.

But the immediate implications (and harsh realities) are more important to anyone thinking of putting their money into this circus.

After all &mdash; the bad reputation of speculating isn't actually a mystery.

Fortunes &mdash;

I mean **the-British-aristocracy-poaches-most-if-not-all-of-your-daughters _fortunes,_** not muh-blockchain-and-microdosing-in-San-Francisco "fortunes"

&mdash; are made at low prices.

Low prices as in deeply unrealized value.

NOT as in hey-maybe-Tesla-could-go-up-30-percent-again.

While speculative opportunities have taken many forms throughout history, **the most important ingredient is wildly under-realized potential.**

The world economy is teetering on the largest pile of debt in human history.

**Maybe you should be ready.**
