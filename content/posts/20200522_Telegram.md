![Telegram ICO fate](../images/c6f281b62b5909d0c5bad.png)

Telegram is a popular messaging app with more than 400 million users.

A couple of years ago, they decided to create their own blockchain platform.

Unfortunately, the SEC thought otherwise. The [project was canceled based on an American legal decision.](https://telegra.ph/What-Was-TON-And-Why-It-Is-Over-05-12)

Telegram and its founders are not American.

No matter. The U.S. court determined a "US citizen might find some way of accessing the TON platform after it launched."

Of course, a U.S. citizen might also find some way of accessing paper stock certificates, right?

Weird how the SEC doesn't enforce global bans on these, even though many are scams.

Why does cryptocurrency get such special treatment? I thought it was a joke?
