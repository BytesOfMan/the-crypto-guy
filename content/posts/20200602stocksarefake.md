Businesses are still closed due to the ongoing Covid19 situation.

Those businesses that will eventually re-open started to try last week.

Now, they have the additional challenge of ongoing riots, looting, and fires.

**American stocks were up on the news.**

Our old friend Chipotle was up 4% yesterday, capping off a 12% run in the 2 weeks since I first [explored the insanity of their stock price.](https://thecryptoguy.com/posts/27-billion-of-burritos/)

I guess, uh, buy when there's blood in the streets?

**What's going on here?**

We are well beyond the traditional investment arena.

Why bother formulating a sound appraisal for the value of a business based on its assets, prospects, and management? Monetary policy decisions will be exponentially more important to the stock price.

The old ideal of the intelligent investor is dead.

**That doesn't mean there are no intelligent investments.**

Look, the rules have changed. But so have the tools.

The biggest problem with traditional investments today is not trying to figure out who will be deemed essential. Nor is it trying to figure out who will benefit most from potential inflation, deflation, or targeted bailouts.

It's the mismatch between risk and reward.

Last week I [wrote](https://thecryptoguy.com/posts/gangnam-style-growth/) about the mismatch between possible gain and loss in the stock market.

Stocks are piling on more and more potential downside.

It's satisfying to complain about this. But it's more important to do what you can to prosper despite situations beyond your control.

People have always responded to strange times by seeking safer investments: namely, gold and silver. And that's still a good idea today.

But, while strange times occur throughout human history, **much of what we are currently experiencing is unique to the present.**

- Amount of global government debt
- Amount of global consumer debt
- Internationaly coordinated central banking cartels

I guess no one really knows what happens when these modern phenomena encounter ancient phenomena like riots.

Maybe I'm the crazy one and riots are great for stocks.

Step one, amass the highest level of debt in human history.

Step two, close businesses for months, then burn some of them down.

Step three...bull market?

**Offense and defense in modern investing**

Today's economic crisis involves challenges new to human history. But there are also opportunities.

Gold and silver are great ways to play defense here. They still have plenty of upside to match their centuries of successful wealth preservation.

Crypto offers a way to play offense. Even today, more than a decade after its launch and many commodity cycles into its history, crypto is still a weird, fringe thing.

The upside to crypto is enormous.

Ethereum is a global super computer that allows anyone in the world to create and execute contracts using software.

It currently dominates this niche. Although many competitors exist, they are either much smaller than Ethereum or built using Ethereum.

All of the Ethereum in the world is today worth $28 billion, or **$1 billion less than Chipotle.\*\*

Anyone can make a burrito!

Anyone can wake up one day and decide, you know, today I am going to eat something other than a burrito. I'll have you know that even the crypto guy does this sometimes. Riots and pandemics are not the only challenges on Chipotle's march to piping guacamole into every American home.

But only a tiny amount of traction would 10x Ethereum, whose all time high remains 5 times higher than its current price.

What happens to Ethereum smart contracts in the event of a riot? In the event of global business closures due to a pandemic?

**They keep working.**

What happens to your local burrito restaurant?
