\_A little learning is a dangerous thing;<br>
drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring<br>

&mdash; Alexander Pope, "A Little Learning," 1709

In 2008, I knew almost nothing about investing.

Worse.

I had read some well-regarded classics like Benjamin Graham's _The Intelligent Investor_.

So I _thought_ I knew a thing or two.

And what timing!

I graduated college as an engineer. The economy was melting down, but I was earning real money for the first time.

Following the 2008 crash, it was popular to buy into recently imploded stocks. I picked AIG.

After cruising for years above $1,000 a share, AIG's stock plummetted to less than $10 when everyone realized they were completely insolvent.

AIG made billions of dollars selling insurance for financial products called Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs).

These were derivative financial products of mortgages-backed securities.

Which were derivative financial products of, you know, actual mortgages.

Still with me?

If you bet on people paying their mortgages, and that bet went bad &mdash; AIG sold insurance to cover your losses.

AIG thought the risk of failure for these products was low. When the housing market fell out in 2008, AIG was on the hook for \$25 billion.

Even at \$7 a share, their stock price was over-valued. The company was bankrupt.

Unless...

**Too big to fail**

AIG ended up being the poster child for this 2008 title. Their stock rocketed to \$56 (I made almost nothing, having sold at \$12 when I realized I had no clue what I was doing).

So uh, what's the classical investment advice for situations like this?

"Well, when you analyze a business that makes money selling insurance on derivatives of derivatives of derivatives, always remember to factor in their political ties, bank interdependency, and timing of the next US election."

Got it.

**This is actually the advice**

Longstanding car rental company Hertz is currently in bankruptcy court.

From [Bloomberg](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/hertz-rally-powers-plan-to-sell-potentially-worthless-stock-1.1449306):

â€‹*Hertz Global Holdings Inc., whose stock appears destined to be wiped out when its bankruptcy case is finished, wants to sell US\$1 billion more of its shares, even though it readily concedes those might wind up worthless, too. Investors promptly bid up Hertz by 68 per cent.*

Right.

_Investors are bidding up Hertz and other bankrupt companies on optimism that the economy and specifically air travel is poised to rebound._

Okay. Rebound to what exactly?

**Why are investors actually bidding up Hertz?**

1. They're delusional.
2. They're desperate for returns.
3. They're speculating that large companies with decades of brand recognition will not be allowed to fail.

The advice of Benjamin Graham and other investment experts is excellent and timeless.

It also doesn't apply to the political impact of derivatives of derivatives.

This is why the Most Famous Investor In The World, Graham-disciple Warren Buffett, [has a cash pile of \$137 billion.](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/why-warren-buffett-unhappy-berkshire-hathaway-record-137-billion-cash-2020-4-1029181516)

He doesn't want to play this stupid game. He recently sold airline stocks at all time lows.

Did no one tell him about the high travel rebound hopes of this new wave of Hertz investors?

**What are the bigger trends at play?**

Crypto investors have earned plenty of criticism.

Many tout unrealistic returns, invest largely by political allegiance, and condescendingly regard investors without a position in crypto as ignorant, lowly "no-coiners."

But investment is not about the snapshot of today. It's about what we may expect in the future.

The crypto market is maturing.

**The stock market is losing its mind.**

Here's another [headline from yesterday.](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/the-dow-crashes-more-than-1700-points-out-of-nowhere-heres-one-reason-why-193300504.html)

**"The Dow crashes more than 1,800 points out of nowhere"**

_"Out of nowhere!?"_

The economy has been turned off for months! Major companies are in bankruptcy! Millions of people are unemployed!

But any drop in the stock market is an almost unbelievable surprise.

**Two trends to watch**

1. The stock market is becoming more like the early crypto market,characterized by euphoria, speculation, and prices that have nothing to do with underlying businesses.

2. The crypto market is becoming more like the early stock market, characterized by (relatively) mature products, analysis, and prices that reflect demand.

Look, crypto today is still the wild west. No one really knows what these assets are worth, and there's a long way to go.

But crypto is moving in the right direction, and crypto is positioned for massive return opportunities.

The stock market is only getting scarier.

To your financial sovereignty,

Joey
