![Peter Thiel and Elon Musk, back in the day](../images/paypal.png)

When eBay bought PayPal for $1.5 billion in 2002, CEO Peter Thiel made $55 million. The largest shareholder, Elon Musk, made $165 million.

Thiel's next venture, a hedgefund, enjoyed much of its success betting against the U.S. dollar.

Paypal's founding vision was also a bet against the U.S. dollar.

>At least PayPal had a suitably grand mission &mdash; the kind that post-bubble skeptics would later describe as grandiose: we wanted to create a new internet currency to replace the U.S. dollar.

-- Peter Thiel in _Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future_

**No love for the U.S. dollar?**

Money nerds, myself included, can go on about this for hours. But who cares?

Until rappers mean something else when they say "money," there's little benefit to challenging the status quo. 

Even PayPal pivoted. "Create a new internet currency to replace the U.S. dollar" is not the same as "helping banks make more transfer fees by recreating checks over email."

As it turns out, glorified checking is still big business. PayPal today is worth $185 billion. To their credit, they have other business lines now (like the tech revolution of uh, loans).

As it stands, there isn't much room for innovation in the payments space. It's a marketing game. Charge a fee for every payment, dominate the market, and you have a cash cow (Square). Or uh, make it social for some reason (Venmo). 

When I got into crypto, I dug into this a bit more. I found payment startup CEOs on LinkedIn and called them to talk about their business (if you're not using LinkedIn for this, why do you have an account?).

Their consensus take?  **Regulation, not technology, is the dominating presence in the payments business.**

This isn't an earth-shattering concept. Bank transfers may take 3-5 days to settle. Are you waiting for a horse to move the money from one bank to another?

Why don't they use a faster horse? Where are the innovators!?

**PayPal today**

Imagine you want to start PayPal's original business today. You want to build a product that lets people transfer money through email.

Tech is not the problem. The tech has been around for years, almost decades.

What about compliance?

What kind of licensing do you need? Who can even tell you? Are you a money transmitter and legally obligated to monitor each and every transaction to uh, fight terrorism? What about fraud prevention? You may need to file special reports called "Suspicious Activity Reports" for transactions over $5,000. God knows what you must file for transactions of $10,000. You don't plan to support international transactions, do you? 

Oh my.

**Crypto today**

I skipped last Friday's newsletter because I was building a new product for Bitcoin.com. [Send.bitcoin.com](https://send.bitcoin.com/) lets anyone send any amount of money to anyone else, through email. I built it in a couple of days.

It only took a few tweaks to an earlier open source product I made, [gifts.bitcoin.com](https://gifts.bitcoin.com/).

PayPal operates under legacy financial shortcomings. Transfer size is limited. Some transfers may be subject to additional scrutiny. Transfers may be frozen for like, no reason. Even if it all works out, you might need to wait a few days and pay a $4.99 fee to get the money to your bank account.

Compare to send.bitcoin.com (built on Bitcoin Cash).

**Anyone can use send.bitcoin.com to send any amount of money to any email address in the world.** You don't need an account. It's anonymous. Transfers settle instantly, for less than a tenth of a penny.

Oh, and it's impossible for the transfers to be blocked, frozen, or confiscated in any way. 

One developer built send.bitcoin.com over the weekend.

**If crypto can do this, why doesn't anyone care?**

The banks are finished! Where are the rappers? 

Right.

Crypto has a long way to go before it's money for normal people. Marketing, for one, is abysmal. What kind of reputation does crypto have with normal people in your life? 

**The opportunity**

Here's a job interview question Peter Thiel likes to use:

> What important truth do very few people agree with you on?

Would you buy stock in PayPal today? The company is "worth" $185 billion. Of course, at current earnings, it will take the business **_100 years_** to make $185 billion. 

Can PayPal really go a century under existing financial limitations?

The market cap for bitcoin is just under PayPal at $178 billion. The market cap of all cryptocurrency is today about $275 billion.

In crypto, the work of a single developer over a couple of days can run circles around PayPal.

Do you think crypto is getting more developers? 

Between crypto and PayPal, which is more likely to see more innovation in the future?

Between crypto and PayPal, which relies on a product that added trillions of dollars to the money supply over the last few months?

If you haven't positioned yourself for the future, the best time to start is now.

To your financial sovereignty,

Joey
