Much to his surprise, King John II of France was having a bad day.

It was the 19th of September, 1356. He had finally trapped the forces of his enemy, Edward "the Black Prince," who had been raiding across the south of France. Outnumbering Edward almost two to one, John opted for pitched battle instead of a siege.

Unfortunately for John, his army was outmaneuvered and overpowered by the smaller English force. Even the precautions taken against his own capture &mdash; 90 knights of his own order in his personal guard, with 17 dressed identically to their King &mdash; proved fruitless after most were killed and his helmet was knocked off.

Finally yielding, he was taken into English custody.

**It's good to be the king.**

Despite the ensuing political chaos in France and what must have been a high degree of personal embarrassment for John, his captivity was comfortable.

He enjoyed a lavish lifestyle and even traveled. Account books during his captivity show purchases of horses, pets, and clothes. He maintained an astrologer and a court band.

After some international haggling (which, naturally, included additional English raids into the French countryside), John's ransom was agreed at 3 million crowns.

**How much?**

The treasury didn't exactly have 3 million of these lying around, so they got to minting. The coins they created showed King John _franc à cheval_ ("free on a horse"), with the reverse reading "Francorum Rex," or "King of the Franks."

It's academic which label was the true source of the name, but people started calling these new coins "Francs."

**This was the first minting of the French Franc.**

Today, 22 countries still use a currency called the Franc, even if France is no longer among them.

**France faced consequences for paying this ransom.**

King John was at the head of what was then a large and powerful kingdom.

Still, minting 3 million francs to get him out of dodge wasn't without consequences. Since the English were not yet fond of paper money, the coins had to be minted with gold (just over 800kg of it, worth about \$45 million today).

John's son Charles, the heir apparent and regent in his father's absence, tried to raise money by devaluing the currency. His moves were [unpopular to say the least,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransom_of_King_John_II_of_France) with a mob murdering key royal officials and forcing Charles to flee Paris.

**Only \$45 million?**

Given the eye-popping numbers we are used to seeing from governments today, this doesn't seem so bad. Indeed, the freedom of a powerful nation's sovereign ruler &mdash; after four years of capture &mdash; came out to [roughly the cost of 0.00017% of Chipotle.](https://thecryptoguy.com/posts/27-billion-of-burritos/)

What a deal!

Well, that was the cash portion anyway. The treaty also handed over a big piece of France.

It would weaken France for the remainder of the Hundred Years War, and they would not finish paying the debt for decades. But they did finish paying it...which also sounds weird to the sophistications of modern finance.

**Why mint when you can print?**

On May 15th the House of Representatives in the United States passed the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act...or the HEROES act, adding another \$3 **_trillion_** dollars to the total cost of legislation related to the Coronavirus pandemic.

If it passes the Senate, the total federal cost of the Pandemic will hit \$7 trillion. In addition, the Fed has expanded its balance sheet by nearly \$3 trillion.

Some predictions:

- The HEROES act will not be paid with gold.
- At no point will the President or Congress need to evacuate Washington due to escape a mob of angry peasants.
- There will be negative consequences from the cost.

If anything, officials are still nervous about appearing to spend too little. The chairman of the Fed went on 60 minutes and personally confirmed he "flooded the system with money" by "\[printing\] it digitally."

Uncharacteristically, he was asked about the potential downside of this action, but [got away with](https://www.sovereignman.com/trends/another-week-another-3-trillion-bailout-27775/) "this is not the time to prioritize that concern."

Can you imagine if King John's son and regent had appeased the angry mob by promising to **_increase the King's ransom_**?

The Parisian rabble did not need _60 minutes_ to know they were being fleeced.

700 years later, we do need _60 minutes_ to know...what exactly?

**You don't have to be a crazy crypto stereotype to think there could be consequences from this bailout bonanza.**

Even the Chairman of the Federal Reserve is saying there will be consequences.

These guys are doing my job for me.

There may be no no example in all of human history of a better reason to own real assets like precious metals, or assets that exist in parallel to the modern financial system like cryptocurrency.

Sometimes I don't know why I bother with King John and the currency created by his capture that went on to have centuries of prominence in modern finance.

**The financial exploits of last week make a King's Ransom seem like a rounding error.**

Note that the Franc succumbed to devaluation and inflation to answer the countless now-forgotten past crises of state. Revalued at 100 to 1 in 1960 as the "New Franc," it was retired for the "Euro" in 2002.

**What action can you take?**

While the Parisian mob preferred a direct approach, this has since become unfashionable. Fortunately, central banks are not the only ones with access to modern financial magic.

The Fed can't print more bitcoin.

Crypto can get crazier, sure.

**But how much crazier would it have to get to stay ahead of legacy finance today?**

You don't have to make a big commitment. You can buy $1, $5, or \$100 of crypto just to see how it works.

And stay tuned for the rest of King John's story. Its direct relevance to crypto persists through a Spanish court ruling in 2012.

To your financial sovereignty,

Joey
