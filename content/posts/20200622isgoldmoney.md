![Action of 5 October 1804](../images/640px-Francis_Sartorius_-_Four_frigates_capturing_Spanish_treasure_ships,_5_October_1804.jpg)

On October 5, 1804, General Diego de Alvear was a rich man with a big problem.

After three profitable decades in Argentina, Alvear was headed home. He booked passage for himself, his family, and his fortune (about £30,000 in gold and silver) on the _Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes_, a Spanish ship sailing out of Montevideo.

The _Mercedes_ sailed for Cádiz in a squadron of 4 Spanish ships. Between them, they carried a kingly treasure &mdash; mostly gold and silver, but also wool, tin, copper, seal skins, and oil. The _Mercedes_ alone carried most of the wealth, at the time valued at £1.2 million pounds.

Back then, £1 pound actually meant 1 pound of silver &mdash; \$258 at today's prices.

In modern terms, the _Mercedes_ carried over \$300 million in cash.

**Hence, the problem**

Less than 100 miles from their destination, the Spanish squadron sighted four British frigates.

Now, Britain and Spain were not technically at war. But Britain was very much at war with Napoleonic France, and British intelligence had learned of Spain's present and future French support.

Alvear, who spoke fluent English, was summoned to the Spanish flagship to assist in the pending negotiation. He took his 15 year-old son Carlos and left the _Mercedes_ for the _Medea_.

Negotiations went bad.

The British wanted the surrender and confiscation of all four vessels. The Spanish were not prepared to agree. Warning shots turned into all out broadsides.

After less than 10 minutes, the _Mercedes_ exploded. Only the front section of the ship and 40 survivors remained.

Alvear's wife and 7 daughters were not among them.

**Collateral damage**

The British viewed the 200 fatalities (and vaporized cash) as a sort of unfortunate side effect of Spain's refusal to surrender. A British court even restored Alvear's £30,000 from the seized value of the other vessels. Alvear would meet an Irish wife and have another 10 children.

**What's the point?**

Today, when every government in the world simply prints or borrows any of the money it needs, it's hard to see the obvious.

Why did Spanish ships brave hurricanes and pirates and the Royal Navy Itself to ship hundreds of millions of dollars from one Spanish jurisdiction to another?

Instead of shipping $300 million in the _Mercedes,_ they could have printed $600 million and been twice as well off!

After all, modern central banks are printing _trillions_ of dollars.

Spanish brigadier José de Bustamante y Guerra prepared for the inevitable.

- start with the action of 1804

- Most of the money was from private individuals

* Remember King John and the English after that French gold
* Lot of that going around
* Somewhat amazingly, France kept paying the debt...even while at war with the English
* Why would you want gold to fight a war?
* Hannibal and the gold mines of Spain
* England yoinking this Spanish gold before the war (great financial planning); wars of 20th century relied on debt
* Isn't it kind of silly that you need to get a bunch of slaves to get this metal and then load it onto incredibly expensive war machines to move it thousands of miles? Is there no better way?
* Perhaps there is not
* Crypto as DEFENSE (unfreezable); you as an individual do not need a warship and an empire
* Encryption is asymmetric
* Crypto as OFFENSE (speculative gains vs USD)
