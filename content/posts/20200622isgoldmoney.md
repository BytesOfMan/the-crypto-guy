![Action of 5 October 1804](../images/640px-Francis_Sartorius_-_Four_frigates_capturing_Spanish_treasure_ships,_5_October_1804.jpg)

On October 5, 1804, General Diego de Alvear was a rich man with a big problem.

After three profitable decades in Argentina, Alvear was going home. He booked passage for himself, his family, and his fortune (about £30,000 in gold and silver) on the _Mercedes_, a Spanish ship sailing out of Montevideo.

The _Mercedes_ sailed for Cádiz in a squadron of 4 Spanish ships. Between them, they carried a kingly treasure &mdash; mostly gold and silver, but also wool, tin, copper, seal skins, and oil. The _Mercedes_ alone carried most of the wealth, at the time valued at £1.2 million pounds.

Back then, £1 pound actually meant 1 pound of silver &mdash; \$258 at today's prices.

In modern terms, the _Mercedes_ carried over \$300 million in cash.

**Hence, the problem**

Less than 100 miles from their destination, the Spanish squadron sighted four British frigates.

Now, Britain and Spain were not technically at war. But Britain was very much at war with Napoleonic France. And British intelligence had learned of Spain's present and future French support.

Alvear, who spoke fluent English, was summoned to the Spanish flagship to assist in the pending negotiation. He took his 15 year-old son Carlos and left the _Mercedes_ for the _Medea_.

Negotiations went bad.

The British wanted the surrender and confiscation of all four vessels. The Spanish were not prepared to agree. Warning shots turned into all out broadsides.

In less than 10 minutes, the _Mercedes_ exploded. Only the front section of the ship and 40 survivors remained.

Alvear's wife and 7 daughters were not among them.

**Collateral damage**

The British viewed the 200 fatalities (and vaporized cash) as a sort of unfortunate side effect of Spain's refusal to surrender. A British court even restored Alvear's £30,000 from the seized value of the other vessels.

**What's the point?**

Today, every government in the world simply prints or borrows the money it needs. It's hard to understand expensive and risky incidents like naval cannonades.

Why did Spanish ships brave hurricanes, pirates, and the Royal Navy Itself to send money from one Spanish jurisdiction to another?

Instead of shipping $300 million in the _Mercedes,_ they could have printed $600 million and been twice as well off!

After all, modern central banks are printing _trillions_ of dollars.

**People in the past were not idiots.**

We love to believe that we are modern, forward-thinking, and well informed. Those old-fashioned people with their gold and their broadsides &mdash; **they're the weirdos.**

But let's pretend. Let's say that marshalling the costly resources of empire usually happened for important reasons.

Maybe Spain knew that printing \$600 million was a dumb idea compared to importing the cash.

Maybe Britain knew it was a dumb idea to let Spain use that cash in the coming war against Britain.

**How does modern finance solve this problem?**

On the surface, modern finance seems to have plugged some of these gaps.

Broadsides are certainly more rare these days. You can even travel abroad without worrying about the Royal Navy murdering your family.

Unfortunately, modern finance has only papered over the age-old problem of who gets what and why. The temporary prosperity afforded by money printing is always tempting.

We have been tremendously fortunate. The prosperity of the last several decades managed to lower incentives for largescale war.

But we are not in a post-human-nature society.

**The global distribution of all the world's gold is almost entirely due to past wars.**

England, then the richest nation in the world, shipped all of its gold reserves to New York to pay for World War I.

Most of Spain's legendary colonial wealth today resides in Moscow. In 1936, Spanish republicans used it to pay for weapons and support in a failed effort to defeat Franco and the nationalists.

75 years later, Congressman Ron Paul asked Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke "is gold money?"

"No," he answered.

Today, the priests of modern finance will not even admit that gold is money (even though they still keep thousands of tons of it in "reserve").

The modern solution is a complicated spaghetti of banks, correspondent banks, and political agreements. You can send \$300 million from the US to Spain by getting various banking officials to agree that it happened. It works great, until it doesn't.

Most people have heard of the December 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The July 1941 freezing of all Japanese assets in the US is less common knowledge.

Asset freezes usually have more mundane causes than American displeasure at the Japanese occupation of French Indochina.

Greek capital controls from their 2015 debt crisis only ended last September. The 2012 Cyprus debt crisis saw accounts frozen and balances confiscated.

**Custodial risk: the problem crypto solves**

Most people do not care about the custodial risk of assets. Most of the time, it doesn't matter. You log into your bank account. Your balance is right there on the screen.

But you don't want to be unprepared when custodial risk does matter. Bank accounts are seized. Ships sink. Armies march.

**It's pretty obvious we're moving into a major economic event.**

The likelihood of asset freezes and outright seizures is growing.

Crypto is not the miracle cure that some of its supporters claim. The custodial risk for crypto is much, much smaller than a bank account &mdash; but it isn't zero. Crypto can be seized by theft, ransom, or taxation (important clues that crypto is money). And crypto has other risks like price volatility.

That's why having part of your financial portfolio in crypto is important. And also why it shouldn't be your only asset. Precious metals are still at surprising lows given all the recent money printing.

And the Royal Navy isn't what it used to be.

To your financial sovereignty,

Joey
