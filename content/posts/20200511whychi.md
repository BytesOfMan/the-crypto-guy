Chicago is an important place.

Ten million people live in its metro area. Its GDP edged past Switzerland in 2018, making it higher than all but 19 nations.

Why?

The other largest cities by population in the U.S. (New York, Los Angeles, and Houston) are all historic international ports.

Sure, Chicago is on the water and roughly central compared to other large American cities.

But so are Milwaukee and St Louis.

**We forget a lot in the modern world.**

Any historical account of a city will discuss how it's strategically located.

Unfortunately, "_strategically located_" is meaningless without context.

Is the place particularly defensible, like Gibraltar?

Perhaps it's near a valuable natural resource, like Johannesburg (founded because of a nearby geological formation responsible for about 50% of all gold ever mined on earth).

Maybe it's both, like the island of Cyprus (the souce of the modern word 'copper').

Nowadays, a valuable natural resource to a city is more likely to be something like an attractive ski mountain. Trust me, Chicago does not have that.

Chicago's modern economy, impressive as the numbers may be, doesn't offer many clues. The number one employer is the federal government.

Followed by Chicago Public Schools. Then the city. Then the county.

So, is Chicago simply an excellent place to, uh, collect taxes?

**Actually...yes.**

Valuable locations experience political complications.

Maybe it's the family ranch and an inheritance dispute.

Maybe its a tiger-themed zoo somewhere in Oklahoma.

Maybe its Johannesburg and the [Second Freedom War.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Boer_War)

**So why is Chicago valuable?**

Chicago is the site of the only navigable waterway connecting the Great Lakes with the navigable waterways of the Mississippi River.

Surveying the area, 17th-century French explorer Robert de La Salle [said](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Portage) _"This will be the gate of empire, this the seat of commerce."_

Let's hope he was not visionary enough to foresee the bloated pensions.

Canals were (and are) vital engines of economic expansion. Physical goods require transportation. A good deal of all trade in the history of humanity has been money going up the river and goods going down.

It's no coincidence that 20% of my posts are about [ships](https://thecryptoguy.com/posts/panics-arent-new/) [loaded with gold](https://thecryptoguy.com/posts/crypto-is-not-digital-gold-but-there-is-a-rush/) (it would be much higher were I not actively restraining myself).

Chicago was valuable because cities (and armies) are better supplied by boat than beast.

A fleet armada of donkeys is equally capable of carrying the burden of, say, an actual fleet armada.

But, among other shortcomings, **_the cost would be much higher._**

**Money also has transportation costs**

Half of every trade is money.

In a world where all trade must be physical, LaSalle was right.

Chicago was _"the gate of empire"_ because of its setting along the lowest-cost route of transportation.

Today, much trade is not physical. Chicago's geography is more cocktail trivia than industrial linchpin.

_But half of every trade is still money._

**What is the monetary _"gate of empire?"_**

With present technology, monetary transaction costs could be negligible. Instead, they are everywhere.

Most costs spring from regulation or inertia.

- Credit card transaction fees
- Compliance staff
- Multi-day settlement times
- Investment bank service fees
- Armored vehicles

When you use PayPal, you may feel like you are taking the canal instead of the mountain pass. But you are effectively forced to drive a mule train onto the boat.

**Why is using money so expensive?**

Earlier, we saw how Chicago's top employers are no longer industries attracted to the area for its important links to navigable waterways. Instead, they represent the taxation attracted to the site due to the wealth it created as a commercial hub.

We have long been witnessing the same phenomenon in modern finance.

It's not that financial transactions must be expensive because technology is lacking. Financial transactions are expensive **because they can be.**

Having the technology to move digital money for almost nothing is unfortunately not enough. You need the technology to prevent regulatory capture.

**Early days**

It is all well and good to pretend we are some sort of crypto LaSalle, boldly straddling the Chicago Portage and foretelling the grand events to come. It's unfortunately not so simple. Even within crypto, political competition has sent BTC transaction fees higher than many in legacy finance.

But unlike legacy finance, crypto _and its internal competition_ are open source.

And **_the remaining challenges in crypto are the only reason there is remaining upside._**

As an investor, the trend is more important than the datapoint. Will more people use crypto in the future compared to today? Will legacy finance become more regulated and costly?

Projects like Bitcoin Cash (BCH) already support rock-bottom transaction fees, and sport the technical tools to instantly accomplish what investment banks do in months for millions.

You can [create a token](https://mint.bitcoin.com/) and [pay dividends](https://tools.bitcoin.com/slp-dividend-calculator) in a few minutes for less than a cent.

**Crypto doesn't have to take over the world for you to make a lot of money.**

We are at the point in the adoption cycle where sophisticated operations are trying to estimate how many people are using crypto. Indeed, the IRS directly asked every American filing a tax return this year. The report discussed in [my last letter](https://thecryptoguy.com/posts/crypto-and-covid-19-three-trends-to-watch/) estimated 60 million crypto users.

But you don't need to know the exact number of crypto users today to know it's relatively low. You can prove it to yourself by trying to talk about bitcoin at a party _(not recommended)_.

[Imminent inflation,](https://thecryptoguy.com/posts/crypto-and-covid-19-three-trends-to-watch/) [tightening supply,](https://thecryptoguy.com/posts/whats-a-halvening-should-you-care/) the current [economic panic,](https://thecryptoguy.com/posts/panics-arent-new/) the [timeless appeal of capital speculation,](https://thecryptoguy.com/posts/speculating-is-timeless/) and the [digital gold rush](https://thecryptoguy.com/posts/crypto-is-not-digital-gold-but-there-is-a-rush/) are all excellent reasons to start a small position (or at least learn how).
