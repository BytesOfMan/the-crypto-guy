![The SS Central America](../images/Wreck_of_the_Central_America.jpg)

After battling a hurricane for 3 days, the _SS Central America_ was sinking.

Her sails were shredded by storm force winds. Her boilers failed, stopping the pumps.

Only a bucket brigade of her 588 passengers and crew, frantically working against the storm, kept the ship afloat.

Finally overwhelmed, the _SS Central America_ went down off the coast of the Carolinas.

425 people were killed. It was September 12, 1857.

On top of the appalling loss of life, she went down with 30 thousand pounds of Californian gold destined for New York banks.

At today's gold price of \$1,700/oz, that's about \$800 million.

So began the Panic of 1857, regarded as the first worldwide economic crisis.

Like the modern economic implosion around Covid19, the sinking of the _SS Central America_ was only the pin that popped the bubble.

Domestic overexpansion, increasing global interconnectedness, and the Bank of England fudging their own gold reserves provided plenty of conditions for a downturn.

And anyway, what's the big deal about removing \$800 million from the economy?

Would the modern economy be rocked if, say, Snapchat's nominal $23 billion market cap fell to...$22 billion?

(Snapchat's business, Snap Inc., has a market capitalization of $23 billion &mdash; presumably for reasons unrelated to their earnings of negative $1.103 billion last year).

Anyway, gold is just a shiny metal, right? Why was its loss such a big deal?

Why were they even bothering to ship so much of it to New York?

After all, the government response to the economic impact of Covid19 involves creating trillions of dollars (so far).

What was so special about that \$800 million in particular?

**Things were different in 1857**

Here is where many crypto articles would discuss monetary theory and hard money and how the Federal Reserve is the largest criminal enterprise in the history of the world.

That's all well and good, but we don't live in 1857 or any theoretical fantasy land.

In our lifetime, we will probably never see a hard money economy with 0% income taxes and the decency to call an economic panic what it is &mdash; a "panic," instead of the modern totally-not-a-big-deal "recession."

**But much remains the same**

A lot _hasn't changed_ since 1857.

Indeed, people (and their economies) still panic when they realize they have substantially less money than previously imagined, whether it's gold bullion going to the bottom of the sea or entire sectors of the economy shutting down in a pandemic.

We regret the purchases and investments made before a downturn (back to 1857: in one Iowa town, lots went to speculators for $1,000 before the panic. Afterwards they could not fetch $10).

Preparing for a similar problem in the future looks a lot more attractive. Saving cash, for example, seems like a better idea than taking out loans to buy assets at all time highs.

**Saving cash isn't as easy as it used to be**

A financial arms race has been waged between savers and institutions of monetary control since time immemorial. The Roman empire physically removed gold and silver from the edge of their coinage to finance spending in excess of taxation. Central banks do much the same thing today, though it's shrouded in fancier shamanism.

When things really get desperate, they can even [outlaw gold ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102) or [keep interest rates at multi-thousand-year lows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_interest-rate_policy).

**How can you protect your wealth in an economic panic?**

1\. Keep some physical cash.

It's not like the bank is paying you interest. Economic crisis conditions have seen restrictions on bank withdrawals before &mdash; restrictions in Greece only ended in 2018, [more than 3 years](https://apnews.com/57fcf1f4694a486aa4b7cd43095ae8ee/After-3-years,-Greece-ends-limits-on-bank-cash-withdrawals) after the most recent debt crisis.

2\. Buy precious metals

Gold saw its all time high after the printing presses were fired up for the 2008 economic crisis. It took some time, not coming until August of 2011. Much more is being printed this time around.

3\. Start a position in cryptocurrency

Monetary institutions once relied on shaving coins. Today they can straight-up print money.

Countermeasures to these policies have also advanced.

Crypto is an optimized bearer asset with attractive speculative upside given its exposure to anyone with a smartphone and \$5.

The Fed will use every technology at its disposal to discourage saving in a downturn.

If you want to preserve your wealth, you can't afford to ignore the latest tools.
