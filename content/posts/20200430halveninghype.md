![The Halvening Cometh](../images/nastya-kvokka-Ifk3WssHNRw-unsplash.jpg)

Maybe you've heard something about the upcoming bitcoin "halvening."

In the 8 years since the first halvening, it's become something of a media event.

**What is it?**

Bitcoin transactions are processed in batches called blocks. The network is designed to process a block every 10 minutes.

Every 4 years, the reward for processing the latest block of bitcoin transactions is halved.

When bitcoin first started, the reward was 50 BTC per block. In 2012, it became 25 BTC per block. In 2016, 12.5 BTC.

And, in 10 or so days from now, it will become 6.25 BTC.

**Why most people think it's a big deal**

The most popular crypto evangelists hold quasi-religious respect for the "halvening."

"The supply is going down by HALF!" they exaggerate. "So obviously the price will go up."

And, historically, the price has gone up. Particularly if you ignore the times it went down.

**Why it's actually a big deal**

**1\. Daily capital inflow required to sustain current price will fall by half**

Right now, 1,800 BTC are generated by mining every day. That's just over \$16 million per day at the latest spot price of \$8,900 USD.

If you assume all newly minted BTC is sold at the prevailing price (and much of it is), then the market requires \$16 million of new capital every day simply to maintain current price levels. That's almost \$6 billion a year.

In 10 days, the amount of capital needed to sustain the current market price becomes \$8 million.

So what?

The number of newly created 1992 Dodge Neons per year has halved all the way to zero. So why aren't 1992 Dodge Neons getting more expensive these days?

**_Bitcoin has value because it is useful and scarce._**

Most of the public clamor (and people trying to find greater fools to make them rich) focus on the "scarce" part. The "useful" dimension is constantly being evaluated by the market.

But even if you concede 'speculative trinket' as the only use, you have to wonder what happens if the amount of capital coming into bitcoin remains the same in a post-halvening world.

After all, bitcoin has been (relatively) stable since its last epic crash at the end of 2018.

**2\. The cost of mining is very real**

You can get a visual idea of how much capital is required to operate a bitcoin mine by watching [this video.](https://youtu.be/K8kua5B5K3I)

The video takes you inside an operating bitcoin mine in China, complete with specialized computer hardware, a warehouse facility, and the required staff to keep everything working.

A top-of-the-line bitcoin miner [costs about \$2,500.](https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=00020200430183716420Ur4VN0710622) For the most part, only top-of-the-line miners are able to make a profit &mdash; and you need hundreds of them for a competitive margin.

These miners must be run at the limits of their hardware to be competitive (so you need staff to constantly troubleshoot). Oh, and they go obsolete in as little as two months.

There are all kinds of angles to take on bitcoin mining as a business.

_Here's the most important:_ **Bitcoin mining has tremendous opportunity cost.**

Do you have \$5 million?

Well, then you could have \$5 million worth of gold, or silver, or public equities, or Tesla stock, or even cryptocurrency itself.

Or you could have a go at bitcoin mining and maybe end up with \$5 million in obsolete computer hardware by June.

So bitcoin is magical internet money and a crazy pipe dream. But real people are putting real capital into one of the riskiest ventures in modern business, and they've been doing it (complete with impressive technological leaps) for over a decade now.

\$6 billion a year in revenue is up for grabs. So some people decide to put their money into a derivative of a risky speculation, one that requires significant specialized knowledge, capital, and dynamic risk.

Maybe they are all insane. But they have more skin in the game than anyone else in crypto, and 10 years is long enough to rule out a motive like pure gambling.

And their business is about to become twice as competitive.

**3\. Impact of media coverage**

I can tell you lots of important long term fundamental reasons why crypto is likely to experience growing demand in the future. Unfortunately, crypto is still so thinly traded that short term price swings tend to be dominated by media events, google search popularity, and other non-traditional indicators.

<a name="whatDoesThisMeanForYou"></a>

When halvenings roll around, people who normally want nothing to do with crypto start asking me about bitcoin. And the price tends to go up, then down, then UP, then DOWN. So, for all the debates and the wondering and the pundits, the net impact tends to be higher prices and a lot of drama.

**What does this mean for you?**

I don't think it's worth your time (or sanity) to fret about hypothetical short term trading advantages in cryptocurrency. I wouldn't tell anyone to buy "because halvening."

Understanding cryptocurrency and owning at least small position in your portfolio are good ideas, halvening hysteria or no &mdash; especially while global internet usage and money supply continue to expand unabated.

Here are some rules of thumb to consider for your crypto portfolio:

**1. In crypto, staying power matters**

The value proposition of cryptocurrency depends on its history. A crypto that has survived in the wild for longer is worth more than a competing crypto with less field testing.

Note: _this does not mean that a crypto will do well in the future because it did well in the past._ But it is distinct from other forms of money. The U.S. dollar has only lost value with time.

One of the most popular questions with new crypto investors: what's the next bitcoin? There are other compelling crypto projects with attractive potential returns, but a substantial portion of Bitcoin's value lies in its 10+ years of proven protocol security.

**2\. Volatility is proportional to market capitalization**

At \$8,900 per bitcoin, the 18.4 million bitcoins in existence are worth about \$160 billion. Right now on Coinbase, it would cost you \$3 million to market sell the spot price down by 10%.

Compare to Bitcoin Cash. At \$256, the 18.4 million BCH in existence are worth about \$5 billion (Bitcoin Cash is the 4th largest crypto by market capitalization. Ethereum is the second largest, at ~\$25 billion, about 15% the size of bitcoin).

Right now on Coinbase, it would cost you under \$1 million to market sell the spot price of Bitcoin Cash down by 10%.

Yes, there are are more factors to consider, but this pattern is true for all assets.

The S&P500 has only seen daily gains or losses above 10 percent on 10 days in its entire history. Bitcoin (and Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum) had two such days _this week._

Smaller cap coins tend to outperform bitcoin in a bull run. From December 2016 to December 2017, Ethereum went from $20 to $1200, a 60x increase. Bitcoin went from $1,000 to $20,000. Eye-popping, sure, but "only" 20x.

Bitcoin tends to fare better in a bear market, though even by faring _the best_ in the current bear market, the bitcoin price still plummeted 70%.

A lot of new crypto investors think this means they need to buy as much of the cheapest crypto as possible.

Please don't do this.

There are diminishing returns to chasing smaller and smaller market caps. Remember, **in crypto, staying power matters.**

If a coin hasn't been around for a few years, there needs to be a compelling reason to believe it will still be around next year (for example, substantial venture capital backing, as with ZCash in 2017).

**3\. Don't go overboard**

If you are just getting into crypto, 1-2% of your total investment portfolio is a reasonable allocation. Even with the relatively exciting price environment we are coming into, 50-80% drops are business as usual in cryptoland.

**Want a starter portfolio?**

Here you go.

1. BTC, 50%
2. ETH, 30%
3. BCH, 20%

So, a \$10k position at this allocation would today be about 0.5 BTC, 14 ETH, and 8 BCH.

You could open this today at Coinbase.com. If you use [this link](https://www.coinbase.com/join/jking_iZ2ADA) to register, we'll both get \$10 free.

While I hold all of the above cryptos, my personal portfolio is weighted significantly more on Bitcoin Cash (BCH). But I'm also something of a BCH partisan whose full time job is writing software for BCH apps.

Remember, **in crypto, everyone has an incentive to sell you their holdings.** You can't expect to completely outsource your research!

The starter portfolio above is modeled for a more conservative crypto investor who isn't (yet) looking to dive into the details.
