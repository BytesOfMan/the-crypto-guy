With inflation all but personally promised by governments and central banks in response to Covid19, it's easy to assume things will go well for crypto.

But economic turmoil isn't necessarily the best time to buy speculative assets.

How will investors react?

Here are a few signs that crypto is being taken seriously as an offensive weapon against inflation:

**1\. Trading volume is high and growing, despite Covid19**

In December 2017, Coinbase saw **\$1.4 billion dollars** of bitcoin trading volume in a single day, its highest ever.

I use Coinbase as a reference because they are a heavily regulated exchange based in the USA. Coinbase makes money by charging a fee on trades. So, there is a real cost to anyone using their service.

\$1.4 billion in trading volume at Coinbase means:

1. Coinbase earned millions of dollars in trading fees
2. \$1.4 billion was traded in crypto _in preference to any other asset_

I talk about opportunity cost a lot at thecryptoguy.com. It's not an accident.

**Opportunity cost is the most overlooked key metric of crypto.**

That's \$1.4 billion _not_ traded on any of the myriad asset marketplaces the 21st century has to offer.

Still, that was a one day blip. What's the trend?

The average daily bitcoin trading volume on Coinbase in 2017 was \$90 million.

That's incredible when you compare it to the average daily bitcoin trading volume in 2016: **\$3.3 million.**

So 2017 saw almost **2,700%** growth in bitcoin trading volume.

2018: \$106 million per day.

2019: \$99 million per day.

2020 YTD: \$135 million per day.

_The biggest question mark over the timing of the next crypto bull market is how Covid19 will impact investment decisions._

The average daily bitcoin trading volume since April 1, when many businesses started shutting down for Covid19, is higher still at \$144 million per day. April 29 saw \$430 million.

So far, _crypto investors have not been discouraged from trading during the pandemic._

**2\. Hash power is 10 times what it was at the peak of the 2017 bull run**

A year before the 2017 top, I was an engineer at the largest semiconductor manufacturing plant in the United States (which was also the largest electricity consumer in the city of Austin, Texas).

At the time (December 2016), the total electricity used to mine bitcoin was _more than four times_ the electricity used by the largest semiconductor manufacturing plant in the USA.

The bitcoin hash rate was then about 2 exaHash/s.

By December 2017, it was 11 exaHash/s.

Today, it's **120 exaHash/s**.

As I wrote about [earlier](https://thecryptoguy.com/posts/whats-a-halvening-should-you-care/), this matters because **the opportunity cost of investing in bitcoin mining is real and high.** People who could have invested in index funds or real estate or precious metals instead invested time, management, and strategy into mining a cryptocurrency.

Does this guarantee they're right? No.

But it does capture real world commitment and preference to other asset classes.

Miners have true skin in the game. Today, it's 10 times more than the top of the 2017 bull run.

**3\. Crypto skeptics are not inflation skeptics**

It's no secret that everyone is looking for returns these days.

With interest rates zero or negative, individuals and institutions have been forced to take on more and more risk to chase smaller and smaller returns.

We've had this environment for almost a decade now, and the response to Covid19 promises only more of the same.

Legacy players are taking bitcoin more seriously, and liking what they see.

In their latest market outlook, titled "The Great Monetary Inflation," Tudor Investment Corp dedicates several pages to bitcoin.

Although compelled to say he's "not a hard money or crypto nut," billionaire hedge fund manager and founder Paul Tudor Jones [points out](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-07/paul-tudor-jones-buys-bitcoin-says-he-s-reminded-of-gold-in-70s) that bitcoin "is literally the
only large tradeable asset in the world that has a known fixed maximum supply" &mdash; as well as "the only store of value that actually trades 24/7 in the entire world."

I don't agree with his assessment that bitcoin is a store of value (Jones is quick to qualify this take).

When you are fighting inflation as an investor, you need tools for offense (speculative capital gains) and tools for defense (preserving your wealth).

**Crypto is offense. Gold is defense.**

Other highlights from his report:

- "Since February, a global total of \$3.9 trillion (6.6% of global GDP) has been magically created through
  quantitative easing"
- Bitcoin "traded \$18 billion of volume on the last day of April"
- "The most compelling argument for owning Bitcoin is the coming digitization of currency
  everywhere, accelerated by COVID-19."

**How you can be ready**

Dedicating at least a small percentage of your investment portfolio to cryptocurrency is one of the most aggressive options available to fight the incoming tsunami of money printing.

Gold is a great way to protect wealth already earned. Unfortunately, it's incredibly hard to buy right now. My local bullion exchange in Vancouver is only offering presales, with delivery in _12 weeks_.

You could own $20, $100, $10,000, or $100,000 in bitcoin _today_.

I've recommended [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/jking_iZ2ADA) before. I think they are one of the best places to start for new crypto investors.

But options are almost limitless. If you're curious about other options, or have any questions about how to use crypto to effectively position yourself against the largest money printing campaign in human history, just send me an email &mdash; joey@thecryptoguy.com
