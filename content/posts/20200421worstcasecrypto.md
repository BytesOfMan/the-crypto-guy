Oil prices [dipped](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52350082) as low as _negative_ 37.63 a barrel yesterday.

So what?

It's not like oil _really_ saw negative territory.

No one was going to pay you \$37 to give you a 300-lb oildrum.

**What's going on?**

Asset prices in the modern economy are strange.

They seem to have less to do with underlying value and more to do with the potential for financial speculation.

We've seen this with housing, university education, tech stocks &mdash; and, of course, cryptocurrency.

The price **is not the value of the asset.**

Sometimes, the price isn't even the price!

Indeed, oil itself was never negative. A financial product related to oil was negative.

Like other assets, crypto prices do not necessarily reflect underlying value. No one knows what crypto is supposed to be worth.

Even in today's increasingly insane financial markets, crypto dominates indicators like volatility, nonsense, and general weirdness.

But at least you're getting what you pay for!

**_One big difference between crypto and most commodities: crypto may be owned directly._**

Anyone in the world with a smartphone can buy or sell crypto within minutes. Even if they have never done it before.

After purchase, it can be held directly in much the same way as (physical) silver or gold.

**Oil isn't the only weird price.**

The price of silver fell to as low as \$11 an ounce two weeks ago, though you couldn't actually find anyone selling physical metal at that price.

In January 2019, WeWork [stated its valuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeWork) at \$47 billion, before a string of scandals rolled that number back to \$10 billion.

But was WeWork ever _worth_ $47 billion? Is it now truly worth \$10 billion?

No.

Could anyone with a smartphone buy a share of WeWork at that valuation?

Again, no. WeWork is a private company and not publicly traded.

**What's this mean for crypto?**

A lot of popular crypto twitter accounts will tell you that because people can own and trade a scarce commodity directly, buying some will automatically make you rich.

The news isn't _that_ good for crypto, though. Oil may be "negative," but the world truly needs oil.

**Crypto in a world of promises**

Most traded commodities _cannot be owned directly,_ least of all by the people who trade them and their end users &mdash; but their utility is clear.

Most traded cryptocurrencies _can be owned directly,_ particularly by end users who can buy and sell them at any volume at any time from any country &mdash; but their utility today is less obvious.

This makes crypto the gold standard for the "utility" of pure speculation.

It also makes crypto the gold standard for niche but growing use cases, like [online poker.](https://blockchain.poker/)

I don't think speculation is the only use case for crypto. Realistically, though, it's been the dominant one for over a decade now, and is likely to remain that way in the short term.

And, for all my distaste for the permanently bullish twitter crowd, there is something to be said for a commodity that may be directly owned with readily available (and growing) ways to buy.

At the very least, the price will never be negative.
