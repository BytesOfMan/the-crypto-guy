On July 15, 1897, the steamer _Excelsior_ docked in San Francisco with 30 passengers. Between them, they carried \$40 million in gold.

When San Francisco learned the news, the Klondike Gold Rush was on.

The mayor of Seattle, William Wood, happened to be in San Francisco at the time and so learned of the discovery a full 2 days before a similarly loaded ship arrived in his city.

The news would have tremendous implications for Seattle, which was the closest major American port.

One can imagine what a modern politician might consider.

_Do we have adequate infrastructure? What additional facilities are needed to support the coming boom? What departments must be expanded? What budgets?_

But Wood was not a modern politician.

He immediately resigned and rushed to join, not even bothering to stop back in Seattle along the way.

**He wasn't alone.**

Nearly all of the streetcar drivers in Seattle left for the same reason, along with 12 policemen.

An estimated 100,000 prospectors traveled to the Klondike between 1896 and 1899, with some 30,000 arriving successfully.

This was a big migration. The entire population of Seattle would not reach 80,000 until 1900.

The Klondike Gold Rush is unique as one of the last great gold rushes, and its cultural legacy endures to this day. Disney's Scrooge McDuck, famous for swimming in his mythical money pit, first struck it rich in the Klondike.

Indeed, we have an almost innate association of gold with wealth. That's why some crypto promoters love to call bitcoin **"digital gold."**

They are missing the point.

**Isn't there actual gold?**

More and more goods and services are becoming digital &mdash; usually for good reason. Physical DVDs, for example, are unlikely to outpace the growth of streaming video.

One of the greatest challenges in crypto: **_bitcoin is neither as simple nor as intuitive as gold._**

The social traditions of trade and value followed by bitcoin are ancient, far older than bitcoin's modern infrastructure of the internet and the microchip.

But bitcoin is not an ancient asset.

**This is the only reason you can still make (serious) money in crypto.**

Look, if bitcoin were digital gold, then gold would be analog Blockbuster. That hasn't happened, it ain't happening, and it's weird that so many crypto people argue with gold people (and vice versa) about the better asset.

The dumbest part about the whole debate?

**"Digital gold"** was popularized as a bitcoin label to paper over the real problem of high bitcoin transaction fees. "Look," crypto Twitter said, "gold is bad at this. And bitcoin is also bad at this! Therefore bitcoin is digital gold...which is good."

**You can own both.**

Want to own gold in 2020? Well, you don't have to quit your job, enter a bidding war for a good team of sled dogs, prove to the commissioner that you have at least a ton of food before crossing the pass, and pray you escape frostbite.

You can just buy gold.

If you are skeptical about thousands of years of humans wanting gold, you could simply learn about it for free.

Of course, the Klondike stampeders didn't battle frostbite in the Yukon simply to own gold. They wanted to get rich. They wanted to own more gold than others by _getting there first_.

Human psychology and the "fear of missing out" are far older than the value we place on gold and indeed cause the entire phenomenon of the gold rush.

It's unfortunate that we are re-learning this nowadays for far less glamorous goods like hand sanitizer and canned tuna, available only after a line-up amid "social distancing."

**Stampedes happen in crypto, too.**

Crypto is not "digital gold."

But gold rushes are not totally in the past.

Bitcoin follows the same ancient social traditions that brought us national gold reserves and the Klondike gold rush. It's a fully digital bearer asset with growing demand, even as it remains something of a nerd joke in between bull markets.

You don't need a ton of supplies and a trusty dog team to participate. You don't need to wait for a steamer to arrive to learn about it.

All you need is an internet connection and curiosity. And, to start a position, you need as little as \$5.
