![Everyone is getting rich?](../images/nyt-bitcoin-millionaires.jpg)

December 2017 was wild. The market cap of all cryptocurrencies made it to around \$700 billion.

In January of 2017, Bitcoin touched $1k for the first time since 2013. During a year of remarkable price appreciation, bitcoin was almost at $10,000 for the beginning of December.

On December 17, 2017, bitcoin was _this close_ to \$20,000.

One year later it would be less than \$3,400.

A similar pattern happened in 2013, when bitcoin ran from less than $100, to more than $1,300 &mdash; then back down to \$200 almost exactly one year later.

Of course, this pattern is much older than crypto. "Bubble" takes its modern financial meaning from the [South Sea Bubble of 1711 to 1720](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_bubble).

"Bubble" is just a nicer way of saying fiasco. The euphemism was probably invented by someone who lost a lot of money and did not wish to feel too bad about it.

Before "bubble," such events were &mdash; with more honesty &mdash; called ["manias."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania).

**Signs of the top**

Throughout 2017, people who had always (rightly) viewed crypto with skepticism started emailing me and asking how they could buy. Bitcoin, so unappealing at $200, was absolutely necessary at $8,300.

Other cryptocurrencies did even crazier things &mdash; and not just the smaller projects. Ethereum, only $20 at the end of 2016, rocketed to more than $1,200 one year later (it trades below \$200 today).

Crypto exchanges saw daily volumes explode and often crashed under the strain. At many exchanges, long wait times developed to register for an account.

One of the most important things to know about speculative bubbles: **never wait in line for an investment.**

Your entry price is the _most critical_ variable in determining how much money you make. And the best entry prices are not found in a stampede.

I saw this firsthand when I went to a crypto ATM in Vancouver that December. I was looking to get some cash &mdash; but, there was a line.

Now in fairness, a line of only 1 person at an ATM isn't too crazy.

But I had never seen someone pull up a chair to an ATM before. The man in front of me was seated, feeding in $100 after $100 bill, buying Litecoin.

It could not have looked more like someone playing a slot machine. Indeed, I am confident this was his understanding of the situation, which means he probably had a better idea of what he was doing than we would like to appreciate.

**Signs of the bottom**

If you are interested in a speculative position in crypto, a better entry point would be a time when

- No one is using these ATMs
- Many crypto companies have gone out of business
- Money printing is reaching historically unprecedented levels

Not to say that such a time would be _the best_ opportunity. But you can be sure that it's _better_.

Look, it's not possible to time the market, and I'm not saying you should try.

We are always tempted to let the perfect be the enemy of the good enough. Why do we even care about optimums like "_the_ top" and "_the_ bottom" when we know they are impossible to know?

**What you can do right now (without spending any money)**

1. Open an account with an exchange. It's free. And, if you buy $100 using [this link,](https://www.coinbase.com/join/jking_iZ2ADA) we'll both get $10 in bitcoin for free.
2. You can also earn crypto while learning about it at [Coinbase Earn](https://www.coinbase.com/earn/dai)
3. Check out [this useful video series](https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/) for beginners

And keep in mind: it's just as critical to know the _better_ times to sell.

If you don't have a plan, you are not going to suddenly discover one when when prices are popping 100% every 2 weeks.
