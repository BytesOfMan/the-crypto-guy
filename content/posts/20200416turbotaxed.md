**_"Crypto? You made \$50k off that shit?"_**

I spent 25 minutes on the phone yesterday with Ed, a friendly professional billed by TurboTax as having 15 years of experience.

I was looking for confirmation that I did not owe capital gains taxes to the IRS this year.

Unfortunately, in Ed's 15 years of experience, he had seen nothing like my tax return.

On top of the foreign earned income exclusion, US-Canadian tax treaty provisions, software engineering income from a Kittitian LLC paid exclusively in cryptocurrency, and self-directed IRA contributions &mdash; there were $75k in realized gains from cryptocurrency (bundled in with just over $25k of losses).

Indeed, as Ed noted and the IRS will learn, I made "\$50k off that shit."

**Ed isn't wrong**

Most people should ignore crypto. If you have only 5 minutes to assess the potential benefits and risks, do not even use them.

**Run.**

For most people most of the time, simply assuming that all crypto is a scam is the best mental model. The truth is not far off.

**This isn't a perfect solution.**

Today, for example, you wouldn't be far off to model the entire financial world as a series of competing scams:

So what can you do?

**The best way to learn about crypto is to use it.**

_But then you have to buy it! And anyway I thought you told me to run._

Sure. But you can also buy a few dollars of crypto, or get some for free. I'll review these options, along with my personal crypto portfolio, in a webinar soon.

I actually built an <a href="https://gifts.bitcoin.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">open source app</a> designed to give free crypto to new users (_eat your heart out Ben Bernanke_).

For now, here's \$2 for the first reader to claim it:
