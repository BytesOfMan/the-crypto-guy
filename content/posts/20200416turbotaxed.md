**_"Crypto? You made \$50k off that shit?"_**

I spent 25 minutes on the phone yesterday with Ed, a friendly professional billed by TurboTax as having 15 years of experience.

I was looking for confirmation that I did not owe capital gains taxes to the IRS.

Unfortunately, in Ed's 15 years of experience, he had seen nothing like my tax return.

My taxes are unique.

- Foreign earned income exclusion
- US-Canadian tax treaty provisions
- Software engineering income from a Kittitian LLC (paid exclusively in cryptocurrency)
- Self-directed IRA contributions

And, indeed, as Ed noted and the IRS will learn:

- $75k in realized gains from cryptocurrency (bundled in with just over $25k of losses for "\$50k off that shit")

**Ed isn't wrong**

Most people should ignore crypto.

For most people, assuming that all crypto is a scam is the best mental model. The truth is not far off.

**This isn't a perfect solution.**

For example, you could also assume the entire financial world is a series of competing scams:

So what _can_ you do?

**The best way to learn about crypto is to use it.**

_But then you have to buy it! And anyway I thought you told me to run._

Sure. But you can also buy a few dollars of crypto, or get some for free. I'll review these options, along with my personal crypto portfolio, in a webinar soon.

I actually built an <a href="https://gifts.bitcoin.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">open source app</a> to give free crypto to new users (_eat your heart out Ben Bernanke_).

For now, here's \$2 for the first reader to claim it:
