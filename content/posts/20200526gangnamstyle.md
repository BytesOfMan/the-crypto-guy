_Hey, I just met you,_\
_And this is crazy,_\
_But here's my number,_\
_So call me maybe._

Familiar?

No one knew Carley Rae Jepsen when she released _Call Me Maybe_ in December 2011.

Then Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez tweeted about the song after hearing it on the radio.

The impact was immediate.

_Call Me Maybe_ dominated the radio well into the summer of 2012. It also held the top position on YouTube.

Then came, of all things, an invisible horse dance.

Released on July 15, K-pop singer Psy's _Gangnam Style_ became an overnight global pop phenomenon.

Rapper T-Pain tweeted the YouTube video for _Gangnam Style_ soon after its release.

So did Britney Spears. And Katie Perry. And Tom Cruise.

By August 28, _Gangnam Style_ passed _Call Me Maybe_ to take the #1 spot for YouTube daily views. In November it beat out Justin Bieber to become the all time most viewed video on YouTube.

In December, it became the first YouTube video to reach 1 billion views.

**The Impact of Tech**

Psy's accomplishment would have been impossible 20 years ago.

The internet changed the size and response time of the market.

Today, the potential for such meteoric success is old news. Even the phrase "viral video" is stale from overuse.

**Enter Crypto**

When it comes to crypto markets, I like to be as skeptical as possible.

What are the worst case scenarios, and do they still involve upside?

For example, let's assume crypto is all a big joke.

Pretend it's some guy in Korea dancing on an invisible horse.

Nobody _needs_ that.

Is it instantly available to anyone in the world with a smartphone?

Yes.

Are world leaders forced to comment on it during popularity surges, reinforcing existing trends?

Yes.

President Obama attempted Psy's famous dance in 2012, during the exponential run-up of _Gangnam Style._

During the last exponential upsurge in crypto, Obama lamented crypto's potential consequences.

"If in fact government can't get in, then everybody is walking around with a Swiss bank account in their pocket."

**Scenario Planning: Stocks**

Say you put \$10,000 into the stock market today. You decide to buy shares in a mid-sized company.

You choose a company like Chipotle [(up 7% since our last analysis)](https://thecryptoguy.com/posts/27-billion-of-burritos/).

What is your best case scenario?

People might keep plowing money into the stock market. Maybe the Fed will start buying Chipotle stock. You could get another 20%.

What's the worst case scenario?

Hm. Well, we're coming off one of the longest bull runs in history. In 2008, we saw the S&P 500 plummet 45%, with many companies (especially in financial services) losing much more.

If Chipotle stock fell by 50% tomorrow, it would still cost more than 40 times annual earnings. You would need a 75% drop to take the stock price in line with price to earnings ratio historical averages.

So a 75% loss could be considered _reasonable_.

But recessions are not about _reasonable_ drops. Asset prices tend to drop below their value.

So we're looking at a worst case scenario loss of more than 75% of your initial investment.

**Scenario Planning: Crypto**

We'll start with the worst case. Bitcoin fell more than 70% from its all time high in the years following its 2017 surge. And this drop was actually modest compared to other cryptos.

Ethereum, for example, fell off more than 90% from its all time high, and even today remains about 80% off.

A 90% drop is always on the table with crypto. This is one reason it's a good idea to keep most of your portfolio in other assets.

So the worst case scenario for crypto is today more or less in line with the worst case scenario for stocks.

**But the best case scenario is very different.**

Take the complete skeptic's approach. Assume that any and all price growth from crypto is based only on the same trends responsible for _Gangnam Style_ YouTube views.

Well, that was more than enough for thousands of percent gains in 2017 (and the bull run before that, in 2013).

International appeal was one of the reasons _Gangnam Style_ pulled so far in front of _Call Me Maybe_, which was more of a North American phenomenon.

**International appeal is another advantage crypto has over stocks.**

Sure, you can buy stock in foreign companies. But it's not as easy as watching a foreign YouTube video.

Celebrities tweet about stocks, too, often to great effect (and legal repercussions).

But stocks are already cruising near all time highs, even as more businesses start to file for bankruptcy amid the continued Covid19 shutdown.

Stocks are a mature asset class trading near all time highs. Today, stocks have the potential for marginal growth and catastrophic loss.

Crypto is an emerging asset class trading near 4-year lows. Crypto has about the same loss potential as stocks, but with exponentially higher upside.

Buying crypto is as simple as [clicking a link.](https://buy.moonpay.io/?apiKey=pk_live_YZodGWRL2oBOR7K3Sc7IVhIrx0MfMm2B)

Nobody knows what's going to happen as the Covid19 crisis works its way through the system. But positioning yourself to maximize benefit and minimize risk is always the right move.

To your financial sovereignty,

Joey
