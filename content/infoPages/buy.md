## Don't you recommend an exchange?

Yes. You can get the lowest fees on crypto by [opening an account](https://www.coinbase.com/join/jking_iZ2ADA) at a crypto exchange. I recommend [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/jking_iZ2ADA), because they are a reputable exchange with years of good business practices and highly competitive fees.

And, if you [sign up with this link,](https://www.coinbase.com/join/jking_iZ2ADA) **we'll both get $10 free when you buy $100 of crypto.**

## But sometimes you don't want to deal with an exchange

Creating and maintaining an account at a crypto exchange isn't for everyone.

You can easily <a href="https://buy-staging.moonpay.io?apiKey=pk_test_1vzuR8pfqnMojMls83TeFyBCW1tm5FOP" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">buy some crypto with a credit card right now.</a>

The fees are higher to use a credit card. **But if you find a better deal anywhere else, I'll match it.**
